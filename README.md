# Multiplayer Chess

## Introduction

Based on the iconic game This was built using plain HTML/CSS and Javascript for the front end and Node for the BackEnd. To create the socket/server interface, Express alongside SocketIO were used to facilitate the interactions between different users of the app, enabling the multiplayer feature between those users.
